How to install:
Download the .hpappdir extension file.
To install the file on your HP Prime calculator, whether it's a physical or emulator device, drag it to the connectivity kit previously installed on your computer.

How to use:
Define your local variables from line 308 in the "local vars" section and then define the names of the subroutines in the "local functions" section of the application you will develop.

In the START() initialization function, the constructor function is named Main(). This is where you should write your application coding using the Nabla API tools. In the following lines, you should write the other auxiliary functions of your application. In the documentation, you will have some examples of applications using the Nabla API.
